        <br>
        <p>How long can a person survive without water? The text book answer is 3 days.<br>
        This is however going to depend on a lot of factors. How well was the person hydrated before?
        How hard are they going to work or exercise now? How old where they? How hot is it? How windy is it?<br>
        There are multiple factors involved in how long a person can last without water and how quickly they might become dehydrated.</p>
