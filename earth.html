        <p>Once the primary needs are taken care of its time to think about food. What are the ways to find it, clean it cook it and eat it. Knowing plants in your area is useful. But know them well. Eating the wrong thing at the wrong time could very well kill you. Foraging is often one of the last things taught, because it difficult to know all about all plants everywhere and general rules are not easily avialble. We will be exploring our back yard and local environment, researching what we do before hand and so should you. Before eating any plant, insect or animal, be confident that you know what it is, know the risks and are comfortable going ahead. We will also be exploring the uses of plants and items in the environment for creating cord and tools. There may be some crossover and duplication with other pages, but repetition keeps it in your head. </p>

        <p>Its winter in South Africa. We decided to supplemment our lunch with some greenery and herbs from the garden. We tried to stick to indigenous plants.
        First up was some Black Eyed Susan.Here we decided to use both the flowers and leaves. The younger leaves were softer and more tender, whilst the older leaves tended to be a bit dry and unappetising. <br>

        The we had a look at some sage. A common herb, not really indigenous, but good for a salad and in our garden. Five or six leaves and leave the rest of the plant for another day</p>

        And from there we moved on to the clover. Often found in shady spots and in the lawn, clover has a tart taste and we decided to chop it finely so that it was not overpowering.</p>

        <p>Nasturtiums are a common plant in the garden in S.A. and have bright orange flowers nearly as big as the leaves. The leaves and flowers are edible and both have a slightly pepper taste, so good for seasoning as well.</p>

         <P>Pelargoniums. Wide spread in S.A. and other couontires and continents, this plant has been used in teas and for other medicinal purposes. However we used in our salad. Again choosing smaller softer leaves, which were more appealing than the larger leaves, which can be quite hairy or furry. Pelargoniums also have quite a strong fragrance. I am tempted to try making some soups and sauces with this plant just for the aroma.The leaves can be darker or lighter, or have dark rings towards the center. There are different types of pelargonium, with different coloured flowers. I believe all are edible, but if not sure one should always check.</P>
