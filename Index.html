    <h1> Delta Face Survival</h1>
    <br> 
    <p> There are hundreds of survival videos on you tube and as many websites on the "how to" of survival. Having learnt first hand that watching and doing are not the same, and also that some of the claims made are not always true, Kaeden will be trying and testing the various projects and techniques. On this page you will see what we have tried, where we have failed and also where we have decided the technique is impossible or so difficult to replicate as to be of no use. 
    Kaeden is not a survival expert or bushcraft genius. So if you are just regular folk who want to be prepared, or more experienced and like seeing what everyone else is up to, then WELCOME!
    <br>
    Practise makes perfect. Or so we are told. It also makes doing things under pressure or in adverse conditions easier. You get to work out your own style, tweak others techniques and understand better.
    So we will probably repeat ourselves a bit.
